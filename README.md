## Peer-graded Assignment: Prediction Assignment Writeup

This repository is created to share a report of the Peer Assessment project from Coursera’s course Practical Machine Learning, as part of the Specialization in Data Science by John Hopkins University. 
This analysis meant to be the basis for the course quiz and a prediction assignment writeup. 

## File structure

The main outcome of this project is the [html-report](PeerGradedAssignment_PracticalMachineLearning.html). Figures included in the report are store in [this folder](PeerGradedAssignment_PracticalMachineLearning_files/figure-html).

The report is created using a [Rmd-file](PeerGradedAssignment_PracticalMachineLearning.Rmd). 

The data which is used for this exercise is downloaded and stored in the [data-folder](data\).

As some parts of the exercise require significant computational time, caching of resutls is used. The cache is stored in [this folder]( PeerGradedAssignment_PracticalMachineLearning_cache/html).
