## Peer-graded Assignment: Prediction Assignment Writeup

This repository is created to share a report of the Peer Assessment project from Courseraâ€™s course Practical Machine Learning, as part of the Specialization in Data Science by John Hopkins University. 
This analysis meant to be the basis for the course quiz and a prediction assignment writeup. 

The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which 6 participants did a Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl, a weight lifting exercise, based on measurements of on-body sensors. Based on a training dataset, a machine learning model is built. A report describes how the model is built, how cross-validation is used, what the expected out of sample error is and which choices are made during this process. Finally, the prediction model is used to predict 20 test cases.

## File structure

### Report
A direct preview of the final html-report can be found [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Velhorst/PredictionAssignmentWriteup/blob/master/PeerGradedAssignment_PracticalMachineLearning.html)

The main outcome of this project is the original [html-report](PeerGradedAssignment_PracticalMachineLearning.html). 
The report is created using a [Rmd-file](PeerGradedAssignment_PracticalMachineLearning.Rmd). 
Figures included in the report are store in [this folder](PeerGradedAssignment_PracticalMachineLearning_files/figure-html).

### Data
The data which is used for this exercise is downloaded and stored in the [data-folder](data).

### Cache
As some parts of the exercise require significant computational time, caching of resutls is used. The cache is stored in [this folder]( PeerGradedAssignment_PracticalMachineLearning_cache/html).
