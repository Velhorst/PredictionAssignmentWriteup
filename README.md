Peer-graded Assignment as part of the course on Coursera: Practical Machine Learning by John Hopkins University


## Peer-graded Assignment: Prediction Assignment Writeup

This repository is created to share a report of the Peer Assessment project from Courseraâ€™s course Practical Machine Learning, as part of the Specialization in Data Science by John Hopkins University. 
This analysis meant to be the basis for the course quiz and a prediction assignment writeup. 

## File structure

The main outcome of this project is the html-report. Figures included in the report are store in the folder PeerGradedAssignment_PracticalMachineLearning_files/figure-html.

The report is created using this Rmd-file. 

The data which is used for this exercise is downloaded and stored in the data-folder.

As some parts of the exercise require significant computational time, caching of resutls is used. The cache is stored in PeerGradedAssignment_PracticalMachineLearning_cache/html.
